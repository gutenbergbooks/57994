<h3><a name="OUR_RECEIPTS" id="OUR_RECEIPTS"></a>OUR RECEIPTS FALLING BEHIND.</h3>

<p>It is with great regret that we call the attention of our readers to our
diminishing receipts. We have been cherishing the hope that we would
be spared this necessity. But the receipts in February are so much
below the receipts of the corresponding month of the previous year, that
unless the loss is quickly retrieved we shall be embarrassed all the rest of
the year. In February, a year ago, we received $21,897.74. Last February
we received only $12,389.79. This is a loss of $9,507.95. Until
February we were well ahead of last year. But the drop is so great that
our total receipts up to the first of March are $3,438.16 less than they
were at the same time the preceding year. In church collections and individual
donations, we are behind $5,389.31! We earnestly ask the
attention of all the friends of the American Missionary Association to these
facts. What is the reason for so heavy a falling off? Are we failing to
keep the necessities of our work before the churches? In our thought
that the Association was getting nicely out of the woods, have we relaxed
our efforts and allowed other things to slip in and crowd the Association
out? Something has happened. That during the month of February&mdash;which
ought to be one of the best months in the year&mdash;only a little over
$12,000 should find its way into our treasury, is occasion for anxiety. We
have had our bills to pay and we have borrowed the money and <em>paid</em>
them. In so doing we have incurred a debt. We could not avoid it without
leaving our missionaries unpaid. We must speedily be reimbursed, or
else back again into the hated bondage and hindrance of financial embarrassment
we inevitably fall. We appeal to our friends to spare us this
humiliation and vexation. We ask this favor, namely: Will pastors and
individual friends please take this question of our outlook upon their

the months intervening before summer vacation, to secure so much to our
treasury that during the summer months we shall be spared the agony of
special appeals and special efforts? “A prudent man foreseeth the
evil and hideth himself.” We are urged to be prudent now by the very
unpleasant memories of what we have been obliged to do every summer,
for several years past. Will you join us in foreseeing the evil and help us
to avoid it?</p>

<a name="CONSECRATION_WEALTH" id="CONSECRATION_WEALTH"></a>

<p>We are from time to time reminded that the old abolition friends of the
A. M. A. are rapidly passing away. They will soon all be gone. There
was something in their friendship that challenges our admiration. They
gave the Association such a hearty support that there could be no question
but that prayer and gifts went together. So also they have in many
instances shown the wisdom of giving generously during life. The recent
death of Mr. Lewis S. Swezey, of Rockford, Ill., gives emphasis to these
thoughts. He helped organize the Liberty Party, and was one of a few
who first voted in the town of Rockford for Birney for President. Though
his whole estate did not amount to more than $10,000, he gave to the
Association a one thousand dollar bond in 1885, and another amounting to
seven hundred and fourteen dollars in 1886. At his death he left the
Association a life policy of $2,000, and $500 in his will. He made the
A. M. A. his residuary legatee, from which our treasury will probably
realize about $5,000. His sympathy for the colored people may be seen
in the fact that one of the last acts of his life was to give a poor old colored
woman in Rockford a hundred dollars to repair her house. When dying
he said to his wife, “This seems like crossing the river,” and in response
to the question, “How does it look on the other side?” replied, “Very
bright, very bright.” And no wonder. He had laid up his treasures
where neither moth nor rust corrupt, and where thieves do not break
through nor steal. Money given to the Lord during life is followed with
no regrets at the dying hour. Were Christians thoroughly possessed of
the conviction that such work as the A. M. A. is doing must be prosecuted
and sustained as a religious duty, we believe their offerings would be
far more generous than they are. A sense of duty as expressed in their
gifts would be accompanied by a sense of delight. Our prayer is that the
surviving old abolition friends may be long spared us, and that the
places of those who have fallen may be speedily filled with worthy successors.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>“It is with pleasure I assist you. I have made several of our young
ladies life members during the past few years, to get them interested in
the A. M. A. Anything I can do to help on the good work, be sure and
call on me for, and I will do all I can for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think the placing of the work of the Association before individual
church members is productive of good results, as I find that only those
well informed of the Society’s needs contribute regularly and liberally to
its support.”</p>

<p>“We are to make a careful canvass of our congregation, with a view to
increasing our missionary offerings, and securing a larger number of regular
readers for our missionary magazine. Can you send us ten or a dozen
copies of <span class="smcap">The American Missionary</span> to be used by our district visitors?”</p>

<p>“My gifts to the A. M. A. have been necessarily reduced to meet my
change in circumstances. I gave five dollars at our last collection, which
was the price of a cushion in my pew. I believe that under the circumstances
the hard side of a board will be softer than the soft side of a cushion.
There is no special merit in it, but I feel that it is an encouragement
to the workers to know that many in the churches are willing to
give up little comforts for the sake of them and the cause.”</p>

<a name="NEW_PASTOR" id="NEW_PASTOR"></a>

<p>The new pastor of the Park Street Church, Boston, Rev. David Gregg,
in his first sermon after installation, discussed the duties of the Pulpit
and the Pews. One who heard it said at the close, “Well, that was a sermon
that would please the secretaries of our benevolent societies as well
as the rest of us.” Depend on it, that any sermon of which such testimony
can be borne has two things characteristic of it: One is, it must be a gospel
sermon, and another is, it must be interesting. It has been our privilege to
read the sermon as reported in the Boston daily papers. It fills the bill.
It is full of the gospel, and a thrill of interest runs all the way through it.
Speaking for the Secretaries of the A. M. A., we can say they are pleased,
intensely so. Here are two brief extracts that sufficiently justify their
pleasure: “Is it the duty of Park Street pulpit to accept the service and
co-operation of the Park Street pews? The pulpit here and now solemnly
performs its duty, and declares its acceptance of co-operation and service.
I have come among you for this very purpose. I come to beseech you to
throw yourself for all you are worth into the work of the church, I come
to command you in the name of the Lord that you love, not for yourselves.
I greet your locked-up wealth, and ask it to come forth from the
vaults of the bank to meet me and to join me in the work of Christ. I
promise you to be the most liberal man in the world in dealing out your
money from your pocket-books, and in accepting and in giving away your
time. I am willing that every righteous and needy cause under the broad
heavens shall call upon you for aid. I come among you to tell you that
you have the same obligations before God to consecrate yourselves and
all you have to the gospel that Jesus Christ had when he lived his sublime
and devoted life. I put a gospel mortgage this day upon the pastor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
people of this church, and upon all that we have, by way of brain and
heart power, and gold and trade, and time and business, and natural endowment
and acquired attainment. Park Street pews, you can offer no good
thing to the pulpit of this church, in order that you may glorify Christ and
build up his cause here, that the pulpit will not take and publicly credit.
This pulpit welcomes to the service of Christ every agency filled with
the spirit of Christ.” *   *   *   *   *   *   *</p>

<p>“If we are to realize the possibilities open to us as pastor and people,
we must keep a constant eye upon the land and age in which we live. Our
age and our country speak to us to-day. Because our lot has been cast in
them, they have a claim upon us, and their voice should be heard. Our
age is an age telling of ages, and it commands us to meet the duties of the
hour. No relations in life ought to be more helpful for this than our church
relations. There is no place for mediæval fossils outside of a museum.
The demand of the hour is for living men and living women. Our age is
a pivotal age, a cardinal age, a burning age, a crucial age. Let us not forget
that we are living under the westering sun of the 19th century, and
that this lays us under obligations to be 19th century Christians.</p>

<p>“While we forget not the age, we must not forget the land in which we
live, and which expects an outcome of good from our church relations.
America is the land where the battles of the future are destined to be
fought. In push of discovery and of civilization there is no land beyond
this. The fields of America are the outer rim of the earth, and
here the nations of the world, crowded out of the old lands, meet, and here
all the great problems and questions of ages must be debated and settled.
Our land cries for help, and we can help it. We can give it the gospel of
Jesus Christ and that is what it needs above all things. The gospel alone
carries in it the principles which can solve with safety and finality the
social and political questions which are coming to America to stay.”</p>

<a name="DECISION_SUPREME_COURT" id="DECISION_SUPREME_COURT"></a>

<p><span class="smcap">By treaty stipulations</span> the Chinese in this country are guaranteed the
same rights and privileges as are accorded the most favored nations. One
Thomas Baldwin was arrested by a United States Marshal for driving out
with force and violence a number of Chinese residents from the town of
Nicolaus, California. The circuit court refused to discharge him upon a
writ of habeas corpus. An appeal was taken to the United States Supreme
Court. The Supreme Court looked the matter through and found that
while the United States Government has the <em>power</em> to provide for the
punishment of those who deprive the Chinese of their treaty rights, there
is no statute law by which it can exercise its power! The decision of the
circuit court was therefore reversed. Justices Field and Harlan dissented.
In a separate opinion, Justice Field held that if the Chinese could not be
protected in their treaty rights, neither could the subjects or citizens of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
any other nation. This is a beautiful attitude for the great United States
to be placed in before the eyes of the world. Making treaties when it has
not power to compel its own citizens to observe them! What a farce.
Is it to be supposed that if this were understood nations would go to the
trouble of making treaties with us? Were the questions at issue about
the Chinese raised in regard to subjects of Great Britain or Germany or
any of the first or even second-class powers of Europe, is it to be supposed
that any such a decision would have been formulated and promulgated by
our Supreme Court? We do not question the ability nor the integrity of
our justices. The probability is that in the <em>strict</em> construction of the law
they are right. But even judges, when put to it, can sometimes find such
latitude in the field of interpretation as to warrant them in setting aside
mere technicalities rather than to allow justice to be defeated.</p>

<p>That such eminent jurists as Field and Harlan found interpretations
that justified them in dissenting; that the circuit court in California
found reasons for refusing to release Baldwin from custody, would
certainly indicate that the decision is fairly challengeable. It is a
national humiliation. It ought to be so felt by the people. It would be
so felt if regard for right and justice were supreme in the national
heart and conscience. It is to be hoped that this matter will be brought
by the proper authority, as soon as practicable, to the attention of Congress,
and that the United States Government will speedily be clothed
with statutory power to enforce its own treaties. If this decision shall
have the effect of getting us out of the painful predicament that it reveals
our Government to be in, we may reluctantly accept it as a means of grace.
Meanwhile even China is on record as being far more Christian in her
treatment of our people than Christian America is in its treatment of hers.</p>

<a name="CHINESE_INDEMNITY_BILL" id="CHINESE_INDEMNITY_BILL"></a>

<p><span class="smcap">Money compensation</span> is a very poor return as an offset to outrage. Congress
passed the bill appropriating $147,750 to indemnify the Chinese
sufferers from the Rock Springs riots. Hon. Wm. Walter Phelps, representative
from New Jersey, spoke words upon its passage for which every
Christian in the country must feel grateful. Said he:</p>

<p>“I want to pay this amount because the Chinese Government asked
for that sum. The sum represents only the property destroyed. The Chinese
Government knows that our Government never likes to pay a claim in full, so
it wisely presents its bill only for the property destroyed, and says nothing
of 28 men murdered&mdash;nothing of 15 men wounded&mdash;nothing of 700 Chinese
hunted for ten days with club and rifle like rabbits, until they were dispersed
into the wilderness and their village was made an ash heap.</p>

<p>“In the time when Great Britain was at war with China, an American citizen
named Edwards was arrested by mistake as an Englishman, imprisoned
from sunrise to sunset, and then released. The Chinese Government paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
$31,600 for the injury done to his person and to the dignity of the United
States. There were 700 Chinese who suffered at Rock Springs&mdash;all of
them more than this man. We hesitate to pay them $200 each. Recall
the familiar story of heathen generosity&mdash;how China once gave us $700,000
and said: ‘Take it and pay the claims of your citizens.’ We took it; we
paid the claims with twelve per cent. interest, and there was enough left
to return $200,000 to the Chinese Government.</p>

<p>“If this seems ancient history, long after the Rock Springs massacre there
was a riot in Ching King. The rabble destroyed property belonging to
the American Methodist Missionary Society. The Chinese Government has
already paid $25,000 for these losses; and also, since our discussion on this
bill, a riot, under similar circumstances, at Shanghai, destroyed other missionary
property. The Chinese Government has paid this bill too, $5,000.</p>

<p>“I have no heart to speak of the obligations founded in the international
law. I don’t want even to refer to the treaty, where we pledged ourselves
to exert all our powers to devise measures for the protection of Chinese
subjects in this country. It is not on the ground of legal, but of the moral
obligations that I prefer to rest this claim.”</p>

<a name="TREATMENT_OF_INDIANS" id="TREATMENT_OF_INDIANS"></a>

<p><span class="smcap">Our treatment</span> of the Indians is very much like the way a kindly parent
allows his judgment to be at the mercy of the pranks of his mischievous
boy. The boy takes a stick, and chasing a dog, pokes it and pounds it till
the maddened brute turns upon his tormentor and bites him. This enrages
the father, who forthwith takes his gun and shoots the dog. In strict
justice he ought to have taken the stick and applied it to the back of the
boy. The good man had no ill will whatever toward the dog, nor would
he ever have thought of shooting it had the poor brute been let alone
and not tantalized into biting the boy. But the dog having been enraged
so as to become dangerous, there was nothing left but to destroy it. White
men&mdash;some of them not even citizens of the United States&mdash;in violation of
law enter the Indian reservation, steal the Indians’ ponies, drive off their
cattle, shoot down a few of the Indians for resisting them, or perhaps for the
mere fun of the thing. The Indians, maddened by the wrongs inflicted
upon them, go on the war-path. The savage stirred with anger strikes
back, and the innocent with the guilty&mdash;if indeed the guilty do not go
scot free&mdash;are made to suffer. Had the Indian been let alone he
would have remained peaceful and quiet and friendly. But by desperadoes
he has been maddened to go on the war-path in vengeance, to retaliate
for wrongs he has suffered. Then follow the blood-curdling stories of
ambuscade and massacre. Popular indignation is roused. Extermination
of the Indian is demanded. There is nothing left now for Uncle Sam
to do but to send his army and put the Indian down. A pity that the chastisement
cannot be inflicted on those whose wickedness started the mischief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bishop Whipple</span> bears the following testimony to the good effect of
making the Indians feel the responsibility of individual distinctive effort
for themselves by vesting them with individual rights of property and by
compelling them to live by their own labor:</p>

<p>“Twenty years ago we began with a small number of Indians at White
Earth Reservation. They were wild folk, used only to savage life. Now
there are 1,800 people living like civilized beings. They have houses
built by themselves. They are self-supporting. It is an orderly, law-abiding,
peaceful community. In religion they are about equally divided
between the Episcopalian and Catholic churches. The laws are administered
by an Indian police. This year they raised 40,000 bushels of wheat
and 30,000 bushels of oats. They have a herd of 1,200 or 1,500 cattle,
several hundred horses, swine, sheep and fowls. They are proud of their
homes and of living in them like white people. They are as neat and
orderly as old-fashioned Dutch housekeepers. They are excellent cooks,
too; they never need to be shown twice how to cook anything. Their
sewing is the most beautiful I ever saw; it is impossible to see the stitches.
They have made all the carpets and bedding I have in my house. The
contrast, therefore, between these White Earth people and the scattered
bands of Chippewas shows plainly what can be accomplished with them by
adopting right methods. The latter are utterly degraded.”</p>

<p>In the February <cite class="citesc">Missionary</cite> we commented on the causes which had
led the Executive Committee of the Freedmen’s Aid Society of the Methodist
Episcopal Church to direct the Trustees of the Chattanooga University
to ask Professor Caulkins for his resignation. This the Trustees refused
to do, and, in view of a current expectation that colored students
would again seek admission, they have passed a series of “whereases” affirming
that the University was designed for white pupils, and not intended to
be a mixed school; that well-equipped schools for colored pupils were
easily accessible; that to admit colored students would injure the school,
defeat the object for which it was established, alienate the races and prove
especially detrimental to the interests of the colored people; that the
General Conference had declared the question of mixed schools to be one
of expediency “to be left to the choice and administration of those on the
ground, and more immediately concerned,” and then wound up with a
resolution declaring that they deemed it inexpedient to admit colored
students to the University, and instructed the Faculty to administer
accordingly.</p>

<p>Such action on the part of the trustees could not be permitted to pass
unnoticed. The Executive Committee of the Freedmen’s Aid Society
called a meeting of the Board of Managers, and submitted for consideration
the above-noted “<em>whereases</em>” and “<em>resolution</em>.” The whole subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
received full consideration. We have not space to publish the report in
full, but it is all summed up in the last resolution, as follows:</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That if the Chattanooga University fail to secure the resignation
of Prof. Wilford Caulkins, to take effect at a date not later than the
close of the present school term, and to so modify its action as not to exclude
from instruction in that institution students on account of race or color;
<i>i. e.</i>, if the said university fail in either of these particulars, we hereby
instruct our Executive Committee to secure, by agreement, if possible,
with the Trustees of said University, the immediate termination of the
contract between the Chattanooga University and the Freedmen’s Aid
Society; and, in case a termination of said contract be not secured by
mutual agreement, in either of the contingencies named above, to notify
the Trustees of the Chattanooga University, within sixty days from this
24th day of February, 1887, of the termination of the contract as provided
in the same.”</p>

work that they could find. Over thirty schools have been supplied with
acceptable teachers from our schools.” We have here an illustration of
what is taking place more or less in connection with all our schools. We
are supplying teachers for the public schools of the South. Reports that
tell only of what our missionaries are doing among those whom they personally
reach, fall far short of that larger work, which, through their scholars,
they are doing all over the South. Think of the difference between a

<h3><a name="HENRY_WARD_BEECHER" id="HENRY_WARD_BEECHER"></a>THE END OF A DISTINGUISHED LIFE.</h3>

<p>The death of Rev. Henry Ward Beecher has evoked a widespread expression
of interest. His funeral was more like that of some distinguished
statesman, over whose bier all political and religious differences are forgotten
and only the good connected with his life remembered. It was certainly
a most remarkable demonstration.</p>

<p>And why all this? Because he had worked himself into the popular
thought as the faithful champion of reforms and measures that touched
the popular heart. His pulpit power, as an orator, made Brooklyn famous
the world over. His splendid victory in turning the tide of British opinion
on the side of the Union as against secession by his marvelous speeches
in England, challenged and won the admiration of his countrymen who
were loyal to the integrity of the republic. But what more than anything
else created an affection that his death has resurrected, and that will
make his name famous so long as its memory remains, was his fearless
and uncompromising Abolitionism. Plymouth pulpit was a battery
whose shot and shell made continuous breaches in the defenses of slavery
during the days preceding the great conflict, and when the conflict came,
it was heard as a voice in trumpet tones calling the people to battle and
steadying them in courage and determination. The preacher saw with
prophetic eye not only the preservation of the Union as the issue, but the
emancipation and enfranchisement of the slaves. Mr. Beecher was, therefore,
always the friend of the American Missionary Association. For eleven
years he was one of its vice-presidents. At Lawrence, Mass., in 1870,
he preached its annual sermon. Its representatives have always been welcome
to his pulpit, and its work has always been sustained by the contributions
of his people. It was fitting that the same man who had been the
undertaker for John Brown and Owen Lovejoy should perform the same
service, as he did, for Mr. Beecher. It was fitting that a Virginia Confederate
general and former slave-holder, and a Massachusetts colored commander
of the William Lloyd Garrison Post of the Grand Army of the Republic,
should march arm in arm, as they did, at the head of the procession
when the body was carried to Plymouth Church under escort of the 13th
N. Y. Regiment, of which Mr. Beecher was the chaplain. It was fitting
that the last letter Mr. Beecher wrote, and which he left unfinished, should
be, as it is, about a colored man and the word of God.</p>

<p>And it is fitting that <span class="smcap">The American Missionary</span> should join, as it does,
with the tens of thousands who testify to the wonderful power, the marvelous
achievements, the great value of the varied ministrations of this
justly distinguished and remarkable man, and who thank God that the
transcendent wealth of his great mind, and tender, sympathetic heart was
consecrated to the service of the loving Father, who bestowed it, in behalf
of liberty, justice, equity and right.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_NEGRO_ON_THE_NEGRO" id="THE_NEGRO_ON_THE_NEGRO"></a>THE NEGRO ON THE NEGRO.</h3>

<p>The New York <cite>Independent</cite>, always on the alert for information concerning
the colored people, and fearless in its championship of those people’s
rights, has published under the above caption seven most interesting
articles.</p>

<p>A circular was sent to two hundred representative intelligent colored
men and women in the several Southern States, “to ascertain the prevailing
opinions and feelings of the colored people themselves about the relation
of the races and the outlook of the colored race.” The seventh article,
which is a summary of the answers received, we take great pleasure in publishing:</p>

<p>“<i>Material Prosperity and Ambition of the Negro.</i>&mdash;There is a practically
unanimous opinion (the dissenting opinions coming from a few communities
which have abnormal hindrances) that the colored people are becoming
home owners with great rapidity. The proportion of families who
own their own homes is variously estimated, and no estimate is trustworthy
for statistical uses. But all the correspondents report an ambition to accumulate
property, and the accumulation of more and more every year. The
great mass of the blacks are not real estate owners. The great mass of
black families are yet tenants; but the progress making in the acquisition
of land seems to be satisfactory. In most Southern communities, land is yet
very cheap, and the mere ownership of land does not argue material prosperity
to any great extent; but the ownership of homes does argue a social
advancement that is exceedingly significant. There is reported from some
communities a lingering opposition by the whites to the disposition of land
to Negroes. But this has had the natural effect to make the Negroes the
more ambitious to become land-owners. In most communities this opposition
seems to have disappeared, or at least to have taken the modified
shape of opposition to the Negroes’ acquisition of the most desirable land
for residences. The race is indisputably laying the foundation for all
healthful progress.</p>

<p><i>The System of Wages, Credit, etc.</i> There is very general complaint of
the credit system which prevails in most Southern communities. The
most grievous shape this takes is the payment of wages in supplies,
whereby an oppressive interest is exacted, and by the nature of the system
generally made necessary. By such a system the thrifty are taxed to
make up for the thriftlessness of the rest. It is at this point, in fact, that
the industrial servitude which yet lingers as a relic of slavery obtrudes
itself most oppressively. The abolition of this system is necessary
for the material advancement of the South&mdash;of both races alike;
necessary for the elevation of the laborer and for the promotion of his efficiency;
necessary as a corollary to the Emancipation Proclamation; and
necessary as a means of freeing the whole system of Southern labor (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
employer as well as the employee) from inefficiency. No conceivable
amount of extraneous capital invested in the South would so add to material
prosperity as the abolition of the credit and supply system. The
labor problem there is to effect this emancipation. As for wages, they
are low, but their lowness is not itself a cause of distress. It is the system
which keeps them low and keeps labor inefficient and taxes thrift and
skill, and puts a premium on thriftlessness and untrustworthiness, that
does the damage. The gist of the whole problem is here.</p>

<p><i>The Races and the Laws.</i>&mdash;The statutes of the Southern States are
not a matter of complaint, except the bastardy and marriage laws; but
there is a very general opinion that in the execution of the law, race prejudice
appears. One correspondent lays great stress on a fact which several
others mention, that many ignorant blacks often fancy that they are
the victims of injustice when they are not. The opinion of the colored
practitioners of law is practically unanimous that a Negro tried for
certain crimes is more likely to be convicted than a white man for the same
crimes, and likely to pay a heavier penalty where the penalty is discretionary
with the court or jury. The marriage and bastardy laws of several
Southern States at least concentrate the pressure to crime at the weakest
social point, and do not give the Negro woman a fair chance, nor the same
protection or reparation that the white woman has.</p>

<p><i>Schools and Churches.</i>&mdash;In the answers to the inquiry whether the
Negroes themselves prefer separate or mixed schools and churches, a peculiar
state of feeling was made plain in this regard&mdash;that “union” or
“mixed” schools were opposed by the colored teachers because the white
teachers would then have a monopoly of the business of teaching. This
implies a belief that the Southern whites would teach Negro schools if it
were made profitable. The dominant sentiment of the colored people is
decidedly in favor of the present system of separate schools and churches;
but they prefer them because mixed schools and churches would emphasize
and provoke the race prejudice. As an independent question, apart from
the difficulty of readjusting a plan now almost universally adopted, they
would prefer mixed schools and union churches. The most intelligent of
these correspondents, even as things are, favor mixed congregations and
schools as a means of eradicating race prejudice.</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice that several correspondents declare that the
separation of the congregations of the same creed on the color line has had
much to do toward causing the blacks to doubt the sincerity of the religion
of those who, though they teach that their religion is universal in its
application, allow it to yield to race feeling. This is a significant confession
for colored men to make; and it is worthy of the attention of the
Southern churches.</p>

<p>“<i>Civil Rights.</i>”&mdash;There is a unanimous protest in these letters against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the discrimination made between the races on public thoroughfares, and
at places of amusement. The desire of the colored people for the obliteration
of the color-line in these places seems to be universal and is strong.</p>

<p><i>The Most Pressing Need.</i>&mdash;-In answer to the inquiry, “What is the
greatest hindrance, and the most pressing need of the race?” the Negro’s
appreciation of instruction, and his ambition to be educated, were forcibly
expressed. “Education is the greatest need,” is the answer in substance
of every correspondent. In the replies it was made plain that the race is
prepared for an important prohibition movement. Drink is thought to be
the greatest hindrance by a large number of the colored lawyers and
teachers, as well as preachers. This points to a probably early agitation
of prohibition over a wide Southern area. The colored man himself
appreciates, too, the necessity of practical instruction, instruction in the
trades.</p>

<p><i>Morality and the Mixture of Races.</i>&mdash;A general moral improvement
is what the Negro himself believes his race is making; and this belief is in
itself strong evidence that this judgment is sound. But the dominant
opinion is that the black race is already perceptibly disappearing. Colored
men are everywhere reported to prefer light-colored women. There is a
race pride on the Negro’s side as well as on the white man’s against intermarriage.
But the Negro has, nevertheless, reached the conclusion, if
these letters are representative of the race’s opinion, as they are believed to
be, that the pure African will become rare in a very few generations, and
that he is doomed to extinction.</p>

<p>It remains to be said that the letters which have been received in answer
to these <a name="TN1" id="TN1"></a>inquiries show not a little mature thought. They show, too, a
profound interest in all phases of the subject. The Negro is at least seriously
thinking over the problems that his presence presents. Many of
these correspondents have expressed great interest in this investigation,
and have put themselves to no little trouble to make it full and fair. The
sincerity and frankness of these letters have spoken for themselves. A
deep moral purpose pervades most of them that is impressive. They emphasize
the conviction that the race is making an heroic struggle, according
to its opportunities for advancement. That the Negro is true to his
race, moreover, is a fact of some importance. The educated are working to
educate the rest.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy, moreover, that out of all the answers received only two
displayed bitterness of race feeling. The Negro’s temper, as shown in
this correspondence, is the temper of a patient, charitable worker for a
great purpose. And, above all, the Negro has faith in the Negro. It has
not occurred to a single correspondent to express doubt of the continued
advancement of the whole race.”</p>

<h3><a name="RELIGIOUS_DOGGEREL" id="RELIGIOUS_DOGGEREL"></a>RELIGIOUS DOGGEREL.</h3>

<p><cite>The Sweet Songster</cite> is the name of a little hymn book published in
Catlettsburg, Ky. It contains verses composed, compiled, altered or
amended, according to the sweet pleasure of one Edward W. Billups, D.D.
There are some old familiar hymns scattered through the book, but often
sadly marred by omission, alteration or addition. Some of the original
effusions are ludicrous in the extreme. The poet shows his estimate of
education as he describes the Christians of old:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Small learning they had, and wanted no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not many could read, but all could adore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No help from the college or school they received,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Content with his knowledge in whom they believed.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Calvinism has to take it hot and heavy. The sweet singer lets sweetness
take a vacation, while he pours forth his wrath in song:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is a reprobated plan,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Say how did it arise?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the predestinated clan<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of horrid cruelties.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The plan is this&mdash;they hold a few<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who are ordained for heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hold the rest a cursed crew<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That cannot be forgiven.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If all things were fore-ordained,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or finally decreed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would like to know why mortal man<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is responsible for his deeds?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Calvinism thus be true,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all things fore-decreed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lord has been very kind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unto the devil indeed.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But we do say God’s Holy Word<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Doth no such doctrine teach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if it do, then why do you<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Attempt His word to preach?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if God has fore-ordained<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All things to be just so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then we do say, all cease to pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And to a-fishing go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, my friends, all on you I call<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To mind this doctrine well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It has its birth, not on this earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But in the pit of hell.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>A vision of the judgment day swept the poet’s high-strung sensibilities
and the fires of Parnassus caused him to warble:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I dreamed I was out to the east&mdash;cast mine eye&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The atmosphere calm, and serene was the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So calm, still and awful&mdash;tremendous the sight&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought the last judgment was drawing to light.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The dead all arose immediately then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And covered the earth with both women and men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All standing together&mdash;’tis hard to indite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The aspect most shocking&mdash;surprising the sight.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A pavement of blue from the cloud did go forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extensively reaching from South to the North,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which holy angels stood almost complete,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glorified spirits in harmony sweet.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The next I heard Jesus say come you up here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all the blessed nations up gently did steer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quitting the globe with sweet pleasure did sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A song that had never before tuned a string.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then in the sweet transport my feet left the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without any motion of body or sound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My joys were unspeakably full of delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So loud was the music it wakened me quite.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>We were pleased in the perusal of these hymns to notice that the poet’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
theology took in apparently all men in its broad sweep. We said here is a
man who does not recognize the color line in his thought of God’s redeeming
love. It takes poetry to expand the soul above prejudice and caste&mdash;when
lo, we stumbled across the following:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Roll forward, dear Saviour, roll forward the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all shall submit and rejoice in thy sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When <i>white</i> men and Indians, united in praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One vast hallelujah triumphant shall raise.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>We were mistaken. The colored brother has no recognition. White
men and Indians are to have a monopoly in the vast hallelujah! How the
wings of our poet drooped as he essayed this loftiest of flights. We are
thankful, however, that he did let the Indian come in for a part in the
hallelujah. The war-whoop would not at all be out of harmony in
his <em>kind</em> of a hallelujah chorus! That this “sweet singer in Israel” D.D.
should make some of his songs take on the form of Scripture exposition is
what we might expect, as witness:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was a man in ancient times,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Scriptures doth inform us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose pomp and grandeur and whose crimes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were great and very numerous.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man fared sumptuously each day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In purple and fine linen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ate and drank, but seemed to pray&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Spent all his time in sinning.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">But not one mite would he bestow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Would the rich worldling give him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dogs took pity&mdash;licked his sores&mdash;<br /></span>

<p>The above are samples of versification that we have selected from this
<cite>Sweet Songster</cite>, that our readers may see for themselves the kind of
Christian instruction some <em>white</em> people in certain portions of our country
receive. These selections are certainly ludicrous, yet they have also a
serious aspect&mdash;they point to duty. It would be useless to denounce such
incompetent leadership as is here revealed. It would be folly to argue
either with the leaders or the people whom they lead. We must plant
schools and educate the children. Preach the Gospel in its simplicity, and
let the people hear the truth. The light will destroy the darkness. It
will reveal the deformity and ugliness of error. It will rebuke the assumptions
of ignorance. It will lead the people in their soul-hunger to turn
away from husks and to demand that in song and sermon their poets and
preachers shall give them the bread of life or else keep silent. There is a
wide field here to be cultivated. It lies open before us. We have entered
it. Rich has been our harvesting so far as we have gone. Earnest and
numerous are the invitations that come to us for more workers and
enlarged efforts. These invitations are an appeal to the churches more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
liberally to supply us with means, that we may be able to respond and go
in to possess the land.</p>

<h3>NOTES IN THE SADDLE.</h3>

<p class="center small">BY FIELD SUPERINTENDENT C. J. RYDER.</p>

<p>The following word reached me recently from a part of the field that I
have not yet been able to visit since mounting into the saddle of the A. M.
A. Superintendency. It comes from Romona Indian School in Santa Fé,
N. M. The writer has been a teacher in New England for many years.
He writes: “Perhaps I shall not be believed if I state the case too strongly,
but it is a fact that the Indian girls of the Apache tribes are very bright
and are more docile and make more rapid progress than any equal number
of white children I have ever seen in the course of more than twenty years’
experience in teaching.”</p>

<p>There are 447 of these Apache Indians held as prisoners of war in the
old Spanish fort at St. Augustine, Florida. They are idle, and cannot be
otherwise. They spend their time foolishly, or worse, as idle people
always do. As I looked upon these men, women and children, crowded
together like cattle in a pen, and remembered the stirring words of Prof.
Whipple, prophetic of such grand possibilities for this people, I wondered
if our Government were making the wisest use of these Apaches in holding
them in this confinement, that must result in increased viciousness.
A Christian lady, after looking at these Indians, said: “Why, the very
sight makes me blush for my country!”</p>

<p>An extended trip through Florida brought to me most encouraging
evidences of the prosperity of the work already entered upon by the A. M.
A. in that State, and impressed the imperative need of more work. Doors
are opening in many directions. Schools are crowded to their utmost
capacity. At St. Augustine, in a school-room seating fifty pupils, ninety-six
were packed together.</p>

<p>The flourishing little church at Orange Park is pushing energetically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
towards the completion of its building. It now ranks in its membership
the fourth Congregational church in Florida.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Are the colored people accumulating property? This is a question
often asked by the interested friends of the A. M. A. work. Let two facts
emphasize the affirmative to this question. In Oaks, N. C., the colored
people have purchased more than five hundred acres of land and built
their comfortable cottages around the A. M. A. school and church. When
we remember that the average wages of a working man in that region is
not above ten dollars a month, and that the average colored family is not
fashionably small, the purchase of this real estate proves that they have carefully
economized their scanty earnings. Take another fact: In Thomasville,
Ga., the colored people paid taxes on three thousand one hundred
dollars worth of property in 1880. In 1885, this same people paid taxes
on ninety-five thousand six hundred and six dollars worth of property.
In five years they had multiplied their taxable property more than thirty
times. This represents no unhealthy “boom” in real estate, but an actual
increase in the accumulations of the colored citizens of this flourishing and
beautiful Southern city. The colored people have been given a fair chance
in Thomasville, and this is the use they have made of it. The readers of
this magazine will remember the generous gift of Judge H. W. Hopkins,
Mayor of Thomasville, of a beautiful site for buildings of the Conn.
Industrial School. A fine building has been erected upon this site and in
a few weeks it will be ready for occupancy. There is intense interest in
the community and surrounding neighborhood in this new school. It
will doubtless be crowded as soon as opened. It is to be an industrial
school for girls.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Far removed from arts æsthetic,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Crewel-work and peacock fans,<br /></span>

<p>A trustworthy friend overheard the following remark, made by a lawyer
in the office of a Southern hotel: “I have seen a miracle to-day,” said this
lawyer. “I have actually seen a white man convicted of murder and
sentenced to be hanged for killing a nigger. I never expected to witness
such a thing in this State.” What a fearful comment on the injustice of
these courts of justice in the past! What horrible suggestiveness of unpunished
crimes! But there is in it, too, hopefulness for the future.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At Lewis Normal Institute, Macon, and at Storrs School, in Atlanta, the
number of pupils is limited only by the capacity of the school-rooms to
hold them. In Macon, Bro. Wharton, whom I left in Savannah, when I
pushed southward into Florida, was holding special services under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
direction of the pastor. God’s spirit was blessing his efforts and many
were daily seeking the way of life. It has been a year of great religious
awakening throughout our entire field.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A beautiful gold locket was put into my hands by an earnest Christian
woman, a very saint of God, as her gift to the work of the A. M. A. Blindness
had come upon her slowly, month after month, and she could no
longer see the picture-faces in the locket, so she had them removed, and
gives the locket into our treasury. Who will redeem it, that this touching
sacrifice may accomplish for God’s poor that which she who made it
prayed it might?</p>

<h3><a name="REVIVAL_ATLANTA_U" id="REVIVAL_ATLANTA_U"></a>REVIVAL AT ATLANTA UNIVERSITY.</h3>

<p>Not since 1881 have we enjoyed in this institution so thorough and
satisfactory a work of grace as during the last few weeks. Indeed, on
only one or two occasions in its history have so many been reached and
been led to enter upon the better life. The special interest began during
the week of prayer which was observed by holding a meeting each evening,
and a spirit of inquiry was early manifested and a goodly number promptly
confessed Christ as their Saviour.</p>

<p>Much personal work was done by teachers and older pupils and many
who had been negligent and careless, made confession and renewed their
covenant. Short meetings were continued for a few days longer, and the
seed-sowing and the harvest went on together, and every day some gain
was made, and one after another came to a decision, until nearly all the
students in the family and many of the day pupils were deeply interested,
while some who had withstood many good influences for a long time
yielded to the claims of Christ and took up his service. There was a quiet
and gentle influence manifested in all our meetings so that without noise
and confusion and without protracted services, the work was done and the
blessing came as the dew or the rain from Heaven. No strangers were
called in to help, and no unusual means were employed, and only ten extra
meetings of a general character, most of them of less than an hour’s duration,
were held.</p>

<p>Thus far the new converts, over thirty in number, and representing
about twenty-five different towns, have stood the test well, and most of
them are proving by fidelity in daily duties the reality of their religious
experience. Absent pupils have been reached by the same good influence,
as well as some former students, and the scholars have been encouraged to
write to parents and friends, and thus it will be easily seen how far a light
kindled here may shine and how valuable and precious a reviving at this
center may become. We hope that a few who resist may be softened, that
the timid and halting may be brought in and the great company of day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
pupils may be affected and the neighborhood toward which we are reaching
out more than we have, will be blessed. We are very grateful for
these blessings, to the giver of all good, and very humble in view of our
unworthiness, and very hopeful for larger and continued gifts.</p>

<h3><a name="VISIT_MT_HERMON" id="VISIT_MT_HERMON"></a>VISIT TO MT. HERMON UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</h3>

<p class="center small">TOUGALOO UNIVERSITY, MISS.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 19th of February, President Pope set out to fill his
regular monthly appointment to preach at Mt. Hermon Seminary for
Young Ladies, whose head and founder, Miss Sarah A. Dickey, was a
pioneer in this Mississippi work, and has passed through such trials and
hardships as those who enter at this stage of the work will rarely, if ever,
have to encounter, and who is now reaping a measure of the respect and
honor she so richly deserves.</p>

<p>Clinton is twelve miles or so distant, and the windows of heaven were
just being opened after a remarkably dry winter, so that when Mr. Pope
said to one of the teachers who had not been at Mt. Hermon for four years
and had only heard of the enlargement of the work there, “Will you go
along?” she cried out, “What&mdash;in this rain?” but finally decided to
venture.</p>

<p>Had not Mr. P. been belated an hour in starting, all would have been
well, for they were within four miles of their destination when darkness
and tempest settled round them so densely and drenchingly that the last
third of the way consumed three hours of time, since it was frequently
necessary to stop a few minutes and wait for a flash of lightning to reveal
the road.</p>

<p>The faithful horse was bewildered, and persisted in veering to the
right, as if to get nearer the driver. This finally led to the complete
overthrow of the buggy, the right wheels running up a bank and striking
a projecting root. Mr. Pope was out in an instant and at the horse’s
head, his companion disentangling herself and scrambling out more
slowly, stepping into several inches of soft clay and leaving an overshoe,
which must be pawed for in the darkness, and, upon securing it, taking
her place at the horse’s head. It was found necessary to take poor Rob
out of the shafts, when he gave one or two scrambling leaps up the slippery
bank and stood with his head close against Miss K.; all the time Mr.
P. labored to right the buggy. And how it rained! ’Twas “sic a night” as
“Tam O’Shanter” took the ride in.</p>

<p>While Mr. P. was tugging at the prostrate vehicle, with its two wheels
in the air two men on mules were seen by a broad glare of light hurrying
along the opposite high bank. In response to Mr. P.’s halloo for help,
they called out, “Who are you?” and hastened on. The priest and the
Levite having passed by on the other side, it was hoped that the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Samaritan would appear next, but he had not done so, when Mr. P. succeeded,
unaided, in getting the buggy up and the wet, muddy cushions,
blankets and passengers into it and setting forward.</p>

<p>After a time the darkness seemed to thin a little and the rest of the way
was passed without accident, though the water was deep in all the low
places. How cheering were the light and warmth of the deep fireplace
and the cordial welcome of the Christian teachers to these muddy, wet
and supperless travelers when at last they reached Mt. Hermon!</p>

<p>The next morning, after Miss Dickey had conducted Sunday-school, as
usual, Mr. Pope preached, making use of the preceding evening’s experience
to help inquirers in the way; urging them to move forward, taking
advanced ground with every flash or even glimmer of the light of truth in
their minds and hearts, not waiting to see all the way mapped out before
them, and pointing to the safe arrival at the heavenly home&mdash;the light, the
welcome, the rest.</p>

<p>At their request, Mr. P. has organized a branch, or class, of the Tougaloo
church in this school, and at the communion service in the afternoon
two additional members were received. Then they turned homeward, and
in retracing their course and observing where they had driven, in the unconsciousness
of utter darkness, on narrow and washed-out ridges between
ditches deep enough to make an upset dangerous, they could but be
grateful that in their little experience of itinerating they had fared so well.</p>

<h3><a name="LINCOLN_MEMORIAL_CHURCH" id="LINCOLN_MEMORIAL_CHURCH"></a>DEDICATION OF LINCOLN MEMORIAL CHURCH.</h3>

<p>The Lincoln Memorial Congregational Church of Washington, D. C.,
was dedicated Sunday, January 2, with appropriate services. Secretary
Beard preached an able and practical dedicatory sermon on “The
Struggles of Life,” from the text, “He that overcometh shall inherit all
things.” The dedicatory prayer was offered by the pastor.</p>

<p>In the afternoon another large audience gathered at the Young People’s
Service, which was addressed by Rev. S. M. Newman, pastor of the
First Congregational Church, and others. In the evening Rev. T. G.
Steward, D. D., pastor of the Metropolitan A. M. E. Church, preached an
able sermon on “The Strongholds of Faith.”</p>

<p>The church was organized a few years ago with only eleven members,
including the first pastor, Rev. S. P. Smith. It now has an enrollment of
over eighty and a flourishing Sunday-school. This was the <em>second Congregational
church</em> organized at the National Capital in the midst of a
large, needy and growing population; four other churches have been since
organized, so that our polity is now represented by six churches.</p>

<p>The building, which is large and commodious and centrally located,
has been altered and renovated, and now presents a very attractive appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
The repairs which were begun ten weeks ago have cost to date
$1,300. Over eleven hundred dollars of this amount have been raised and
expended. The lower floor consists of the audience room, which serves as
chapel, with a seating capacity of six hundred and fifty, with spacious
Sunday-school rooms adjoining, which will seat three hundred and fifty.
The upper floor has been neatly fitted up for a parsonage and school-rooms.</p>

<p>In addition to the religious services, a sewing-school for girls, a night
school and a kindergarten are carried on in the building.</p>

<p>The Women’s Missionary Society, music and the industrial work, are
under the direction of Mrs. G. W. Moore. The dedicatory services were
reported in all the Washington daily papers and several weeklies. The
church has a large field of usefulness and a bright outlook.</p>

<p>The A. M. A. workers in the South have many discouragements. Our
work is generally ignored by the whites, and often unappreciated by the
blacks, but such letters as the following show that many fully appreciate
the efforts that are made to purify and elevate the race. We have recently
organized a “Social Purity Society,” and have already the names of over
sixty women and girls on our “White Shield” pledge. After one of our
meetings, at which earnest words of warning and advice were given by
several of the teachers, the following letters were received from two of the
mothers:</p>

<h2><a name="THE_INDIANS" id="THE_INDIANS"></a>THE INDIANS.</h2>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3>OUR DEACON.</h3>

<p>“Young men, never despair of the hardest case,” were the words which
were spoken to some of us, while in Hartford Theological Seminary, more
than fifteen years ago, by a missionary from Africa, and he gave us some
illustrations to prove his point. I was forcibly reminded of this a few
weeks ago as we elected two Indians to serve as deacons, the first Indians
ever chosen to fill that place in the history of this church, for during the
first eleven years of its existence there have been white men connected
with it who have filled that office acceptably. Some time ago, however,
the last one left us, and after waiting a while in vain to see if some other
men would not come, who would serve in this capacity, we decided that it
was best to choose Indians for the place.</p>

<p>One of these has had a remarkable history. About thirty years ago or
more he was baptized a Catholic, but when, after a short stay, the Catholic
priest left these Indians, not to return again, he, with the rest of these
Indians, relapsed to their heathenish ways.</p>

<p>Twelve years ago he was noted for drinking and for the sly ways in
which he could procure his liquor. In 1876 he had great trouble with his
wife and wished to leave her, but the Agent would not allow it. A long
trouble followed, in which the Agent and prominent Indians tried every
way they could think of to make them live peaceably together. One day
the Agent with two friendly Indians went to arrest him, but, with the help
of his uncle, he knocked down the Agent, broke out a window and got
away. He was pursued all day, but was not taken, and at night was
helped off by his relations, and he ran a long way off. For this his relations
were locked up in jail, which brought them to terms, and they induced
him to return so that they could be let out, and he served six
months in jail.</p>

<p>After that he secretly left his wife, took another, and went to another
reservation, sixty miles distant, but in time, with the help of another Agent
and two soldiers, he was again taken and conveyed to Fort Townsend,
where he worked six months more, with a soldier and bayonet to compel
him to do so.</p>

<p>A year or two afterwards he returned to Skokomish. He said that he
had reformed, but was still a Catholic, and he held some Catholic services
at his own house. For a year or two, however, they did not amount to
much, as hardly anybody attended them. In 1881 affairs changed, and
through the death of a prominent Indian, the Catholics became quite
strong, mingling with their teachings spiritualistic revelations from the
dying man, and he was their priest.</p>

<p>The next year another Indian professed to die, receive revelations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
come to life again, and he originated a religion which was composed of
Protestantism, Catholicism, spiritualism, the old Indian religion, and a
nervous twitching, similar to the jerks prevalent in the Southern and
Western States fifty years ago, and which gained for them the name of
Shakers. For a few months they carried things with a high hand, and he
was an acknowledged leader. The Catholic religion, however, grew to be
a very small part of their services, while the shaking grew to be very
large, so that their heads and hands were sometimes shaking night after
night, six hours at a time. To save them from becoming crazy, with the
advice of the physician, the Agent put a stop to this, but told them they
might continue their Catholic services, if they wished, as he had no right
to interfere with their religion as a religion. But they gave up everything,
and asked me to teach them. I gladly did so, and a year afterwards,
in the fall of 1884, he united with our church. Thus he has been
by far the most troublesome Indian of any here, both to Church and Government.
For more than two years he has done well in the church, and
now, with my approval and with the unanimous consent of the members of
the church, he has been chosen their deacon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As I write, an Indian sits before me dressed in leggins with two blankets
around him, and a comforter tied over his head. He has come to get his
horses shod, and as the blacksmith is away, he has to wait. He has sat
stolidly most of the day, his horses out in the cold&mdash;the thermometer is
about 12 or 14 degrees below zero. As he has sat here without an expression
of a single emotion passing over his face, he has occasionally drawn a
deep sigh. He knows his life is wretched, and yet it would take almost a
miracle to arouse him to activity enough to render his life comfortable.
As I contrast him with my own boys and girls, with the emotions aroused
by mental activity chasing each other over their faces, I feel that their
lives will be happier and, I hope, better than his.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CHINESE" id="THE_CHINESE"></a>THE CHINESE.</h2>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>Several articles savagely anti-Chinese having appeared in a Knights of
Labor paper published in Marlboro, Mass., Rev. A. F. Newton sent to the
editor the following vigorous reply:</p>

<p>“We understand the purpose of the laboring classes in their organizations
and publications is to promote the best interests of our suffering
fellow men. And this we do wherever we find a man who has fallen
among thieves on the Jericho road. The fact that he has on the wooden
shoes of Holland, or the queue of China, or the corduroy pants of Ireland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
does not prevent our performing our duty to him as a fellow man. And
any one who abuses any man because of the land of his birth deserves
severe censure from every right-minded man who labors with hand or
head.</p>

<p>“Your inconsistency, Mr. Editor, appears when in one place you say
of the Chinese, ‘This town is afflicted with but few of them, thank God,
and the sooner they disappear the better.’ And in another column you
say, ‘We are willing to do anything possible to aid in promoting charity,
but if creed or nationality is to be considered in bestowing it, just count
us out.’ What is your creed? The one in which you thank God this town
is afflicted with only a few of one nationality, or the one in which you propose
to be counted out unless charity shall be bestowed regardless of
creed or nationality? The man who tries to ride two horses is apt to fall.
Inconsistency always appears ridiculous. We hope the prayer in your
‘Thank God’ does not put you under the condemnation of Proverbs 28:9.</p>

<p>“In behalf of every nation in America, we protest against the abuse of
any people, whether they come from the banks of the Shannon, or of the
Rhine or the Po, the Danube or the Hoang Ho.</p>

<p>“It is urged against the Chinese in one of your columns that their
great sin is in the fact ‘that California has been drained of over $200,000,000
during the last twenty-five years.’ This is an average of $800,000 per
year. But surely this is not a great offence, for Mr. Michael Davitt, at
Madison Square Garden, New York city, recently urged ‘that millions of
dollars had been sent from this country to gladden the poor Irish peasants.’
Every true man will rejoice that the peasantry of Ireland and China
and Germany can be gladdened with money honestly earned by their
friends in America. The heart of one peasant is as precious in the sight
of the Lord as the heart of any other peasant so far as we know.</p>

<p>“We have always held that it was mean for a great strong man to
strike a small one. When we see this done we feel like saying, ‘Take a
man of your size.’ On this principle we shall never admire the 17,000,000
laboring men attacking the 125,000 now in our country. We do not
believe any one has correctly sensed the heart of true workmen when he
tries to win their favor by abusing the few harmless industrious celestials.</p>

<p>“What are the charges you have to make against these Chinese? Are
they disturbers of the peace, are they thieves, are they licentious, are they
riotous or drunkards or paupers? Are they the burden of our courts?
If there be anything I denounce it is national prejudice. Will you
denounce an Irishman because he came from Ireland, or a Chinese because
he came from China? I will not. My condemnation shall fall on him who
violates law and is an unworthy citizen. And then my condemnation rests,
not upon his nationality, but upon his guilt. So long as any man is a
quiet, law-abiding citizen, he can count me his friend. When he sins, I
shall preach to him repentance and reformation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am aware that the problem of foreign immigration is gigantic. But
what kind of a sieve shall be used to strain the stream that is flowing into
America from the Old World? The men who weave the meshes of the
strainer have a Herculean task. Your readers will find it very profitable
to study the ‘evils incident to immigration’ in the <cite>North American Review</cite>
for January, 1884.”</p>

<h3>HOW TO ORGANIZE AND CONDUCT A LADIES MISSIONARY
SOCIETY.</h3>

<p>The Home Land Circle, Park St. Church, Boston, was organized a little
more than two years ago. Three public meetings are held during the
year. Funds are divided among the Am. Miss. Asso’n, the A. H. M. S. and
the N. W. E. C., in such proportions as the ladies decide at one of these
meetings. The names of the ladies in the church and society are taken, a
band of collectors is appointed, and each lady is called upon, and offered the
privilege of contributing. By mentioning the wish to the collector, any
contributor can have the whole of her gift go to the specified society.
Membership is constituted by an annual contribution, no amount specified.
The meetings, we are informed, have been made very interesting by means
of letters from the workers of the societies aided.</p>

<p>Referring to the value of these letters in mission circles, one lady
writes: “While once we felt ourselves to be working blindly, with little
idea of the work that was being done or of the manner in which we could
best help, we seem now to have a personal and friendly interest, as well as
an increased sense of our own responsibility.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The Colored People</span> are crazily fond of organization. Women and men
alike are caught in the whirl. Offices with high-sounding names, processions,
regalia and show, have a wonderful charm before which go down
their better judgment. The evils of the Lodge, our missionaries meet on
every hand. In the home and in the church, this insidious foe to piety
and thrift is encountered. The love of organization may be utilized and
turned to good account. Our teachers endeavor to impress upon their
pupils the value of co-operation in doing good. The outcome of such instruction
appears in one of our schools where the girls of their own accord,
and without aid from their teachers, organized themselves into the Helping
Hand Society, in which the members pledge, (1) Not to tell lies, (2) Not
to steal, (3) Not to be selfish, (4) Not to quarrel, (5) Not to talk about
the boys when together, and (6) To try and help every one they can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, the vice of “Secret Orders” may be seen in the
following, written by one of our teachers:</p>

<p>A colored man with the title of Elder, recently visited this place and
organized a secret society called the Universal Brotherhood. He had left
one church with stains upon his moral character, but, as is too often the
case, another fold had an open door for sheep, goat, or wolf, and, as he
could operate better inside a church than out, he went in. The initiation
fee to the society is one dollar, and the monthly dues are twenty cents.
Small as this amount is, it is much to those who have families to provide
for upon very small wages. If all the promises made by the organizer
could be believed, membership in the society of Universal Brotherhood
would be better than forty acres and a mule. All who are sick are to receive
aid. When a member dies, his family will receive a thousand dollars.
If any one of the family dies before the member insured does, twenty-five
dollars will be furnished for funeral expenses. Heavy fines are imposed
for absence from the meetings, which are held weekly. The name might
lead one to suppose that this lodge is for men only, but it is composed of
men and women. They have oaths and pass-words and secrecy, but one
who is too wise to join such an organization says the great secret which
they will never find out is <em>where the money goes</em>.</p>

<p>The idea of some one to help in time of sickness, and of property left
to one’s children, is enough to draw the final dime from a colored person’s
pocket, and stimulates parents who are not able to patronize a school to
invest in a lodge. A colored woman who does well to send one of her six
children to school said to me last week, “I am just as much opposed to
the lodge as I can be. A good many women have to work hard to support
their families, for it takes all their husbands can make to keep up the
lodges. They pay four dollars a month for the rent of a hall to meet in,
and they can’t pay the rent for a shelter for their families, so their wives
have to attend to that.” The poor woman had the eloquence of truth and
earnestness. She had had enough experience to know what she was talking
about.</p>

<p>They have the lodges, chapters, commanderies, and consistories
of the Masonic order for colored men as well as for white. In
Oddfellowship there are lodges for the men, and the Household of Ruth
lodges for the women. There are the Knights of the Wise Men and the
Sons and Daughters of Relief. The following are some of the lodges for
men and women: Diamond Square, Beulah Temple, Blazing Star Temple,
Daughters of Shiloh, Sisters of Charity, Sons and Daughters of Ham, and
Willing Workers. There are Queen Esther’s Courts, and the United Sons
and Daughters of Abraham, the Good Samaritans, the United Daughters
of Zion, the Star Tabernacles, the Daughters of Union, the Tabernacle of
Love and Charity, the Sons and Daughters of Moses, the Sons and Daughters
of Honor, the Mothers and Daughters of Israel, the Eastern Star, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
United Brothers of Friendship, the Sons of the Mysterious Ten, and the
Immaculates.</p>

<p>In our little town there are but two surviving secret societies amongst
the colored people, but in my opinion there are too many by two. They
rob the home, the church and the school, and are obstacles in the way of
all who seek to promote the best interests of the people. Yours for the
right and the light.</p>

<h3>THE WAY TO DO IT.</h3>

<p class="small center">REV. C. L. HALL, FORT BERTHOLD, DAKOTA.</p>

<p>We have a Badger in our house. He begins with a capital B, and he is
a capital little chap. He can throw his bean-bags into the hole every
time, and he does well in school, too. A year ago his relatives wanted
him to come to our school, but as he could not live in the ground and
grow his own coat as other badgers do, we had to wait till this fall. I said
he could not live in the ground. He did live on it though last winter, for
there was no floor in his house and the sides and roof were made of logs
and mud, and he had a tin cup, and sometimes a tin plate, perhaps, and
that was all there was to supplement his fingers. Some forked sticks in the
ground, on which a board or two were supported, and a dirty quilt and an
old blanket made his bed. The bed made itself, without any neat housekeeper’s
help.</p>

<p>Corn, pounded up in a wooden mortar and boiled in water, and dried
venison and berries, were the principal diet of our Badger.</p>

<p>Now, he is just like a boy&mdash;a white boy&mdash;and he is learning to talk
English fast, and he tries to sing Sunday-school hymns and gets the tune
quite well. Pretty good for a Badger just out of his native hole, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Well, he has woolen shirts, knee-pants, stockings, mittens, and shoes
and cap, etc.; everything suitable for a boy seven years old. You would
not know him from a boy if he did not sometimes get down on all fours
and rub his stockings through at the knees; but we hope he will grow out
of this badgerly habit in time.</p>

<p>Now, there are some boys and girls called the “Torrington Valley
Gleaners,” who like pets so well that they are taking care of this little
Badger. They call him Edward.</p>

<p>They send him clothes and send money to buy his food. They held a
fair, and the boys brought in pumpkins, turnips, celery, pop-corn, etc., not
for the Badger to eat, but to sell, so that they might have money to help
him. The girls made fancy articles for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Now they have enjoyed doing this so much, and they think it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
so nice when they and their Badger are grown up, to feel that they had
helped him to be a man, that they have asked me to recommend their plan
to other boys and girls and to their parents, in Connecticut and other
States also.</p>

<p>We can say that we have a variety of pets for them&mdash;ducks, bears,
weasels, cows and other animals, to whom we give Christian names and
Christian training, so far as Christian friends help us to do so.</p>

<p>Nine of these Indian boys have just gone off in the twilight with their
lady teacher, in a big sled, to get the mail, and a dozen little girls are
making rag dolls, etc., for they all like a little play after school is out and
their work is done. So they have both work and play and are not dull.</p>

<p>May there be many to pray for them and help them that they may
become good servants of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The Rev. <span class="smcap">Geo. F. Magoun</span>, D. D., President of Iowa College,
says “The ‘Hymns and Songs for Social Worship’ is
much the best for use in devotional Church meetings that I
know. It was introduced at Grinnell by my suggestion, and
proves every way admirable and acceptable. While it is richer
and fuller than other hymn and tune books designed for the
same purpose, the choices of old favorites is very fine and generously
large, and that of new and lighter ones (both words
and melodies) is not too lavish or beyond the limits of good
taste. <i>It hits the golden mean.</i>”</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>⁂ Churches would do well to furnish themselves with a
supply of each of these books. They contain many tunes peculiar
to themselves with hymns that are familiar. They
would admirably supplement the hymn books in use.</p>

<p>From <b>Rev. Geo. M. Boynton</b>, Pastor
Congregational Church, Jamaica Plain, Boston,
Mass.: “We have been using ‘Songs of Christian
Praise’ for six months, with great pleasure and
profit. Both the hymns and tunes have impressed
our people very favorably. There is an excellent
variety in the book, so that it is possible to find a

expression of almost any sentiment appropriate to
Christian worship.”</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
